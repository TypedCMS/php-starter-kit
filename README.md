# TypedCMS Starter Kit for PHP

Our stater kits are tailored solutions for each platform, unlike the simple API 
wrappers offered by other vendors. The [TypedCMS](https://typedcms.com) starter kit for PHP 
provides repositories and Eloquent-like models corresponding to your 
collections and blueprints.

This starter kit wouldn't be possible without the hard work of the many open 
source package developers and contributors on which it is built.

## Installation & Usage Instructions

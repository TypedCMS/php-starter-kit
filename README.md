Our stater kits are tailored solutions for each platform, unlike the simple API
wrappers offered by other vendors. The [TypedCMS](https://typedcms.com) starter kit for PHP
provides repositories and Eloquent-like models corresponding to your
collections and blueprints.

This starter kit wouldn't be possible without the hard work of the many open
source package developers and contributors on which it is built.

_This package is maintained by [Honeystone](https://honeystone.com)._
